# OSD-XMB
This is a User Interface for the PS2 resembling the PS3/PSP XMB Style developed by HiroTex,
made on [Athena Env](https://github.com/DanielSant0s/AthenaEnv) by DanielSant0s, and inspired
by the [XtremeEliteBoot+](http://www.hwc.nat.cu/ps2-vault/hwc-projects/xebplus/)
dashboard by Howling Wolf & Chelsea.

## Features

- Plugin System where you can make your own plugins to show items on the dashboard, either on JSON format or more customized with the XML format.

- **Launch PS2 games from USB Drive, exFat HDD, MX4SIO or MMCE**:
    - The App will automatically populate a "Playstation 2" folder on the "Game" Category with all ISO format games that are on your "DVD/" or "CD/" folders at the root of your device (or inside a subfolder "PS2").
	- You can customize your preferred settings for your games if you open the "Option" menu while highlighting the game and select "Settings" (Remember to use	the confirmation button to save changes).
	- The "Show Logo", "Show Debug Colors", and "GSM" settings can be set globally for all games on the "Game Settings" Plugin at the "Settings" Category.

- **Launch PS2 games in HDL Format**:
    - Games installed with HD Loader will be automatically listed on the "Playstation 2" folder. 
    - You can set their Game IDs manually on the "neutrino.cfg" file, or by following the naming pattern "PP.Game-ID..GameName".

> MX4SIO and MMCE are not compatible with each other, so you can only enable one of them.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> APA HDD and exFat HDD are not compatible with each other, so you can only enable one of them.  
Read [The App is not reading exfat HDD](#troubleshooting).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure to have the necessary files on the `POPS` folder.  
Read [PS1 POPS Games are not being scanned](#troubleshooting).

- **Launch PS1 games from USB Drive or HDD**:
    - The app will automatically scan your POPS folder on the root of your USB Drive (and the "__.POPS" partition if present) to list all the .VCD files on the "Playstation 1" Plugin folder in the "Game" Category.
	- The name of the VCD will be the game's name.
	- If no ELF for the VCD is found, it will be automatically created when launching the game.
	- You can set several POPS special settings the same way the PS2 per-game settings are set, by using the Options Menu for each game.
	- More global options (Cheats) are set on the "Game Settings" Plugin in the	"Settings" Category.
    
> [!WARNING]  
> The next feature is disabled by default, if you enable it and the app crashes after the boot sequence, your PS2 has an uncompatible modchip and you must disable the feature manually.  
Read [The App freezes exactly after the Boot sequence](#troubleshooting).

- **Launch PS1 and PS2 games from Discs**:
    - The App will automatically recognize if there is a PS1 CD/CDDA or PS2 CD/CDDA/DVD
  	in the disctray	and highlight it automatically if you're idle on the "Game" category.
	- You can add "(Game-ID).cfg" files on the "CFG" folder with the Item "Title=Game Name"
	to display Customized Game Titles for this Item.
    - To enable this feature, go into "System Settings" and enable "Disc Tray Reading".

- **Execute ELFs**:
    - You can execute custom ELFs by the use of Plugins, or using the File Explorer. The File Explorer will launch any ELF without arguments, but you can make custom plugins to launch Elfs with custom arguments.

- **List SAS APPS**:
    - The App will automatically scan the Memory Cards for valid "SAS APPS" and list them on the "Apps" Plugin Folder on the "Game" Category.
      
- **File Explorer**:
  	- The "File Explorer" Plugin and "Memory Card Utility" Plugin let you Delete any files and/or folders from your devices.
  	  
- **Appearance Customization**:
  	- Besides the default PS3/PSP appearance and its related color settings, The Dashbaord is fully customizable by the use of "Themes" that can be completely user-made to change Icons and Background Images, as well as certain colors of some elements.
  	- There are 2 themes already included with OSD-XMB:
        - `Air Paint`, resembling one of the PS3's default Themes.
        - `PSX`, based on the appearance of the XMB Dashboard of the DESR PSX Console.
  	  
## Instructions

-	It is suggested, but not necessary, to place these files inside a folder on a Memory Card and launch it from there, since the App can be set to auto-boot using FMCB:
    -	`OSDXMB.ELF`
    - 	`main.js`
    - 	`athena.ini`
-	Then you can place the rest of the Assets (Folders CFG,ART,XMB,etc) on a directory called "OSDXMB" on your preferred device.  
  - The following devices are currently supported and will be scanned to look for the App's assets:
  	- 	mass?:/OSDXMB/ (any "mass" device, like USB, MX4SIO or exFat HDD)
   	- 	mmce?:/OSDXMB/
    - 	hdd:__common:/OSDXMB/
    - 	Path where OSDXMB.ELF was launched from.

## Troubleshooting
These are common expected issues, please follow the instructions below to fix them:

<details>
<summary>The App does not launch / Black Screen at boot</summary>

- If using wLauncherElf, please switch your wLE version for an older one or use uLE, current wLE versions have problems running Athena.
- If FMCB is available, consider using FMCB to launch the App directly from the Browser or by Auto-boot/hotkey.
- If using PS2BBL, try enabling the config `KEY_READ_WAIT_TIME = 2000`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>The App freezes exactly after the Boot sequence</summary>

- On your Assets folder, go to `CFG/main.js` (If the file is not there, create it as a text file), and add an entry `cdvd=false`.  
  If this fixes the issue, your PS2 has an uncompatible modchip and won't read CD/DVDs from the disc tray while on the App.

</details>
<details>
<summary>After creating a VMC the game does not start</summary>

- If you are trying to create a VMC on a MX4SIO or MMCE device and you have an USB plugged in, un-plug it from the console before booting OSD-XMB.
</details>
<details>
<summary>MX4SIO is not available</summary>

- In order to enable MX4SIO, MMCE must be disabled.  
To do this, open the `athena.ini` file as a text file, and swap `true` and `false` on the lines:
```
mmceman = true
mx4sio_bd = false
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>The App is not reading exfat HDD</summary>

- In order to enable exfat HDD support, PFS must be disabled.  
To do this, open the `athena.ini` file as a text file, and swap `true` and `false` on the lines:
```
ps2fs = true
ata_bd = false
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>PS1 POPS Games are not being scanned</summary>

- Make sure to have the necessary files inside the POPS Folder:
    - If using USB, make sure to have the files `POPSTARTER.ELF` and `POPS_IOX.PAK` on the POPS Folder.  
    - If using HDD, make sure to have the files `POPS.ELF`, `POPSTARTER.ELF` and `IOPRP252.IMG` on the POPS folder inside the `__common` partition.  
    
</details>
<details>
<summary>The UI keeps moving to the left</summary>

- If you are using an 8bitdo adapter, switch to digital mode by using the button combo `L1 + R1 + Select + DPad Up`. Digital mode is indicated by the LED on the adapter turning white.
